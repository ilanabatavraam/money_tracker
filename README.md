## How to Use

### Step 1: Enter Your **Start Balance** (Cell D3)
- In **D3**, input the total amount of money you have at the beginning of the month. This will act as your starting point for tracking your finances.

### Step 2: Define Your **Savings Ratio Planned** (Cell G5)
- In **G5**, enter the percentage of your total expenses that you aim to save. This value is independent of your income and is solely based on your planned expenses.

### Step 3: Log Your Expenses in the **Data Expenses** Tab
- For every expense, fill in the following fields:
  - **Date** (Column A): The date of the transaction.
  - **Amount** (Column B): The amount spent.
  - **Category** (Column C): The category of the expense (e.g., Food, Rent, Travel).
    - **Important**: Ensure the category matches the predefined list exactly (e.g., no typos or extra spaces) to ensure accurate calculations.

### Step 4: Log Your Income in the **Data Income** Tab
- For every source of income, fill in the following fields:
  - **Date** (Column A): The date you received the income.
  - **Amount** (Column B): The amount received.
  - **Source** (Column C): The source of the income (e.g., Salary, Rent, Other).

### Step 5: Understand **Savings**
The **Savings** tab automatically calculates your savings based on the data youâ€™ve entered. It has the following key fields:

1. **Savings Automatic** (Cell A26/B26):
   - This is the amount you want to save manually each month, regardless of your income or expenses. For example, if you plan to save $800 each month, input this value in **B26**.

2. **Savings** (Cell A27/B27):
   - This value is calculated automatically based on a percentage of your discretionary expenses (all expenses except Rent, Food, and Restaurants).
   - The percentage you want to save is defined in **G27** ("I want to save"). For example:
     - Enter **50** to save 50% of these discretionary expenses.
     - This percentage will be applied to calculate the recommended amount to save in **B27**.

3. **Savings Updates**:
   - **C27**: Enter the actual amount you saved for the month. Itâ€™s important to update this field manually.
   - **C28**: This field is calculated automatically based on the data you provide. **Do not fill this field manually**.

4. **Special Rule for Cigarettes**:
   - If you have expenses categorized as "Cigarettes," 100% of these expenses are added to your savings. For example, if you spend $100 on cigarettes, $100 will also be added to your savings goal.

## Currency-Agnostic Design
This template is designed to work with any currency. Whether you use dollars, euros, or any other currency, the calculations will function correctly because they are based purely on numeric values, without any currency-specific formatting.

## Filling Frequency and Consistency
It doesnâ€™t matter how often you update this planner. For example, you can fill it in daily, weekly, or whenever you make transactions. I personally update it daily using my phone, adding any new expenses or savings. The key is consistency â€” maintaining a regular habit of updating the tracker.

Once you complete the first month, youâ€™ll have a clear understanding of your spending habits. This insight will help you confidently plan your budget for the next month, giving you a better overview of your finances and enabling you to achieve your savings goals.

## Visual Insights
As you fill out your planner, two charts will automatically appear on the **Visual** tab:
1. **Planned Expenses Chart** â€” Displays your planned spending categories.
2. **Actual Expenses Chart** â€” Shows your actual spending by category.

These visualizations make it easy to analyze your spending habits:
- See which categories consume the most of your budget.
- Identify areas to cut back, such as "Installments" or other non-essential expenses.

Using these insights, you can make informed decisions to improve your savings and spending strategies.

## Importance of Savings

It is extremely important to make consistent savings. When you do save money, consider using a separate tool or account that is convenient and understandable for you. It could be a dedicated savings account, investment portfolio, or another method that works best for your lifestyle.

The key is to remove saved money from your regular balance to avoid the temptation to spend it. This ensures that your savings remain intact and grow over time. While I donâ€™t recommend any specific tools, choose an option that is comfortable for you. Ideally, your savings should generate interest or grow in some other way, but the most important thing is to start saving consistently.
